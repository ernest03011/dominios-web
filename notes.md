# Things to note

## Things that I might add/delete/remove later one

### Functionalities

1. Add a section to display the total. A sum of the score
2. Limit the score 200 and display a message letting know X user has won.
3. Showing specific alert letting know that input value can not be empty or that it does not accept text
4. Based on what was added, I could display an alert that shows "XY is not a valid input in Dominio"

### Design stuff that I might edit/add/remove

1. New game button looks too big on Desktop sizes.
2. Making the paragraph in the footer more legible. It is difficult to read when the background is black at times depending on the sizes.

## Feedback

- Empty for now.

## Possible ToDos

- Set a reponsive width to main card, it could be using percentage, like 80, and then center it. As well as adding a max width
- Refactor both CSS and js code
- Add a total display
- Enabling to delete that item, only if, the sum is more than 0
- Adding another page where the user can add the amount of players and their names
- Having a button to reset all values, and a button to start a new game.
- Readjusting the sizes for the heading and card after 1200px width. The button gets too big as well.
