# Capicua (dominó) Website

## About this Repo

This is a repository for a website that is used in order to track the score for a dominó game.
I created this website because I love playing dominoes and I did not want to worry about how
I will track the score, if I have paper, pencil, etc.

## About the Refactor and new Features

- **A more maintainable and scalable css in the long term**: I'll use SASS for this, and bootstrap.
- **Feat**: Dark Mode 
- **SEO**: Add meta tags that will help with the seo, and other tools/techniques, like robots.txt, sitemap, Google Search Console, and so on.
- **Data Management**: Stop using localstorage, and start using another way to promote the data integrity by making it difficult for the user to manipulate the score.
- **UX**: I need to research this one. One thing that comes to mind is making the app easier to use, tutorials, videos, blogs, or anything else that can help with the ease of use. 
- **Interactivity**: Use vuejs to achieve this one. 
- **Testing**: Add test to the website. 
- **Performance**: As part of the SEO, also check the performance using tools like Lighthouse, and so on.
- **Automation**: Use Github Action to automate some tasks like CI/CD, tests, optimize assets, etc. 
- **PWA**: Add a PWA version.
